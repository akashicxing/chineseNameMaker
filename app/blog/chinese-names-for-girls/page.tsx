        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">The Significance of Names in Chinese Culture</h2>
        <p>In ancient China, there was a saying: "有其名必有其实，名为实之宾也" ("yǒu qí míng bì yǒu qí shí, míng wéi shí zhī bīn yě") – meaning "where there is a name, there must be reality; the name is the guest of reality." Names in Chinese culture are not merely labels but are believed to influence one's destiny and character.</p>
        
        <p>Giving a child a name is one of the most important cultural acts parents perform. Many parents begin preparing for this responsibility even before their child is born, hoping to bestow a name that embodies their wishes for their child's future success, happiness, and reputation.</p>
